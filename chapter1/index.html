    <p>My favorite beverage of all time has always been a good old Arizona Iced Raspberry Tea. Something about Arizona having premium brewed tea with a combination of natural flavorings such as honey and ginseng, crafts that well-balanced and yet refreshing taste. In addition to this notion, Arizona Tea is crafted free from artificial ingredients and preservatives, meaning that if you wish to drink drinks or beverages with less sugar, then this tea may be a more viable option for most. Overall, I would highly recommend Arizona's Iced Raspberry Tea.</p>
